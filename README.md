# Don't be a sponsor of Russia 'DBSR' project

'DBSR' can be useful to check whether the company operates in Russia, whether it pays taxes there, whether the company ignores or supports Russian aggression in the world.
It is currently under active development.

## Features

## Development

Want to contribute? Great!
You can create `Fork` send a `Pull-Request`.
I believe that this project will be supported by a large number of volunteers, especially concerned people from Ukraine.
